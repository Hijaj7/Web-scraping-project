# Web-scraping-project
Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. The web scraping software may directly access the world wide web using the Hypertext Transfer protocol or a web browser. Text mining began with the computational and information management fields (eg: database searching and information retrieval), whereas Text analysis began in the humanities with the manual analysis of text. Sentiment analysis is the collection, categorization, and analysis of text using techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) and computation linguistics. This kind of analysis helps companies better understand how their consumers react to particular brands and products. Human expressions are classified as positive, negative, or neutral
